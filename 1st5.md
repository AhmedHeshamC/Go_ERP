## Progress Update

### Priority 3: Fix inventory service test timeouts
- **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED**: 
  - Identified that TestTransferInventoryUsesTransaction is timing out due to complex transaction mocking
  - The issue appears to be in how WithRetryTransaction callback is being executed in the mock
  - Created TestTransferInventorySimple test without transaction manager complexity
  - Added NewInventoryID, NewProductID, and NewWarehouseID helper functions to entities package
  - Created basic inventory test (test_basic.go) that tests core inventory functionality without service complexity

### Current Status
- TestTransferInventorySimple test created and should pass without timeout
- TransferInventoryUsesTransaction test still needs to be fixed or replaced with simpler approach
- Main issue is that the service expects a gin.Context and proper transaction handling
